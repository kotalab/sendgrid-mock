# Go API Server for swagger

# The SendGrid Web API V3 Documentation  This is the entirety of the documented v3 endpoints. We have updated all the descriptions, parameters, requests, and responses.  ## Authentication   Every endpoint requires Authentication in the form of an Authorization Header:  Authorization: Bearer API_KEY

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
